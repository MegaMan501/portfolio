        <p>
          Hey, there my name is Mohamed Rahaman but most people know me as Nabil. I was born in Dhaka Bangladesh and I emigrated to the United States when I was 5 years old. Most of my childhood was spent in Los Angles, CA. Ever since I was a kid I’ve always been curious about technology and how software interacts with hardware. Since, then I’ve moved to Fort Worth, TX, while in Texas graduated from high school and started college career. I am currently attending The University of North Texas, which is located in Denton, TX. My major is Computer Science, and this is my final semester as I am graduating this May 2020. I’ve worked with a wide breath of technologies, focusing on full stack development. The operating system that I use is ArchLinux, I have been on Arch for the past 4 years developing code and virtualization different OS’s to gain an understanding of how multi-platform application development works. Most of the application’s that I have build was done in Linux. However, I did initial develop on Windows. I am an avid hardware enthusiast, I have built and maintained all my families computers, most of which run Linux. I went as far as setting up a custom router by using Pfsense, for the ultimate security and speed focused home network. Additionally, I have multiple home servers for file storage.
